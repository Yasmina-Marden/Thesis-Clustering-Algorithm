Thesis Clustering Algorithm
==============
Python implementation of clustering algorithm I designed as part of my undergraduate senior thesis at Reed College. An R script has been provided for easy visualization of clustering results.

Overview
--------------
The algorithm is an ad-hoc, hierarchical clustering algorithm that allows overlap between clusters. It works in iterations, where each iteration represents a level of the clustering hierarchy. During an iteration, 

Pseudocode
--------------
```
MardenClusteringAlg(G <sup>orig</sup> ):
  var num = number;
  IF ()
    THEN;
    ELSE;
  ENDIF;
END.
```
